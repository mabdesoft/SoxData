SoxData is a Ruby class for parsing and manipulating SoX .dat files. The main focus is currently on granular amplification/resynthesis to assist with feature-detection.

I've recently noticed that SoxData has been downloaded and hosted at http://www.olis.or.kr/ossw/project/detail.do?pid=5400519&cid=01&currentPage=&mapcode= under an MIT license. I deliberately didn't put a license on this software as it is little more than a concept or set of equations so let me be clear: SoxData is NOT currently under an MIT license or any other; you can do whatever you want with it and so can anyone else although I retain the copyright. If you are a representative of Olis or the preson that uploaded my work to their site, you should take it down or modify the associated metadata to indicate that it is not under any license.
